# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest version of psychic-workers v2. Our goal is to avoid breaking changes within major versions, facilitating incorporating security patches by updating to the latest minor and patch version within a supported major version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please contact us at [psychic-security@rvohealth.com](mailto:psychic-security@rvohealth.com). Once the vulnerability is verified, a patch will be provided. Once the patch is provided, a new version will be published closing the vulnerability. Private contact will resume between the reporter and the code maintainers until the vulnerability is resolved.

## Supply-chain hardening

This package is developed and published with defenses against install-time supply-chain attacks (the Shai-Hulud class of npm worm, which runs from a dependency's `postinstall` and/or publishes a compromised version for maintainers to install before it is noticed):

- **Dependency build scripts are blocked by default.** pnpm 10+ does not run dependency lifecycle scripts; `pnpm-workspace.yaml` keeps a deliberately minimal `allowBuilds` allowlist (only the few packages that genuinely need to build). Every entry re-opens script execution, so additions require a clear reason.
- **Release-age cooldown.** `.npmrc` sets `minimumReleaseAge=4320` (3 days), so freshly-published dependency versions — the window in which most worm-injected releases are caught and unpublished — are not installed. Three days stays under the critical-CVE patch SLA, so routine patching never needs a bypass.
- **The cooldown exclude list is `@rvoh/*`-only, enforced in CI.** Only our own first-party packages are exempt from the cooldown. A CI check (`check-cooldown-excludes`) fails the build if any non-`@rvoh/*` entry is added to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`, so a permanent third-party bypass cannot be introduced silently. Apply an urgent third-party patch with a transient, reverted override instead.
- **Registry pinning.** `.npmrc` pins the npm registry so installs cannot be redirected to a malicious mirror.

## Publishing posture

Releases are published **manually, from a maintainer's machine, gated by npm two-factor authentication** — there is no CI/token-based publish. This is a deliberate anti-worm choice: it keeps publishing credentials off CI (a prime target for self-propagating worms that harvest CI/CD secrets) and behind a human MFA prompt. npm provenance / OIDC publishing was evaluated and **deferred** for that reason — adopting it would relocate publishing into automated CI and trade the human MFA gate for a long-lived automated trust relationship. It remains a deliberate future decision, not a default.
